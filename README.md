# 🏴‍☠️ One Piece E-Commerce App 🛒

Welcome to my end-to-end **One Piece Merchandise E-Commerce prototype**! This project was built for my coding assignment using the Lovable platform (no-code/low-code), and features all the core aspects of a modern online shop themed around the anime One Piece.

## 🚀 Features
- Browse awesome products inspired by One Piece 🌊
- Add items to your cart and manage purchases 🛍️
- Secure checkout and order confirmation 💳
- Account login/sign-up and order history 👤
- Custom design using anime-inspired colors and graphics 🎨

## 📂 Repo Contents
- **`main_prompts.txt`** – List of all main creation prompts (feature-building, design, and logic instructions)
- **`debugging_prompts.txt`** – Prompts used for fixing bugs or visual tweaks 🛠️
- **`source_code/`** – Exported code from Lovable (all site files/code)
- **`project_url.txt`** – The link to the live site so you can view/test the app online 🌐
- **`agentic_MCP_explanation.txt`** – Short explanation of how I used agentic AI and multi-component prompts 🧠

## 🔗 Live Project
See my deployed site here: (project_url.txt)

## ℹ️ Project Summary
I built and deployed this shop by breaking major features into small, simple prompts so the AI builder could understand and implement them easily. Debugging/fixes are separated so it’s clear which prompts make features and which just fix small issues. Most of the backend runs on Lovable Cloud, so you’ll see mostly frontend and workflow logic in the code folder. My site’s public—so feel free to try it out!

## 📒 How To Use
- Visit the project URL for a live demo
- Read the prompts and explanation files for details about my workflow and agentic AI use
