PROMPT 7
Please update my website as follows:

Each product card should display its own description and include an ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button. The button must function so that clicking it adds that specific product to the cart.

Every product card must display its product image, description, and a functional ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button.

All product listings must remain consistent across every page. The products visible on the landing page should be exactly the same as the products listed on all other product-related pages, including any additional or newly added products.

For all products (both existing and newly added), always use the provided product images. Do not replace or remove old product images when adding new products; ensure images are updated only if a new image is specifically provided for that product.

Please do not change any existing content, descriptions, or product details except as specified above.

Always use the original provided product images‚Äîdo not ignore or remove previous ones.

Add a complete ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù system to my website:

Each product card should have an ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button. When clicked, it should add that product to the user‚Äôs cart.

Create a dedicated Cart page that displays all items added to the cart, lets users update quantities or remove products, and shows a total price.

Use dummy data or temporary front-end storage for now; you do NOT need to connect to any backend/database.

The design, layout, fonts, and style of the Cart page must match or closely resemble the landing page to ensure a consistent look and user experience across the site.

Please maintain the same color scheme, typography, and spacing as used on the landing page.

Make sure all interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.) on the Cart page look and feel like those on the landing page.

Do not change any existing product descriptions or images except to add the required cart features.

PROMPT 8
Please add authentication (sign-in/sign-up) to my website:

The user must be prompted to sign in (or sign up) when:

They click the ‚ÄúGet Started‚Äù button anywhere on the site.

They click the profile icon in the top navigation bar.

They proceed to checkout on the Cart page (sign-in is required before completing checkout).

The Sign In (and Sign Up) page(s) should use the same design, typography, color scheme, and layout as the landing page for a consistent user experience.

After signing in, users should be able to access their account/profile features and complete checkout.

If a user is not signed in and tries to perform the actions above, redirect them to the Sign In page first.

Please do not change or remove any existing design or functionality except as needed to add authentication.

PROMPT 9
Connect the authentication system on my website to Supabase.
Use Supabase for all sign-in, sign-up, and user management features.
Do not use any built-in or default Lovable backend‚Äîreplace it completely with Supabase integration.

PROMPT 12
Create a dummy checkout page and a confirmation page for my site.
Both pages should use the same theme and typography as the landing page.
The checkout page must use product and cart data from Lovable Cloud, synced with the existing cart system.
The confirmation page should also display order details using this data.

PROMPT 13
When a user clicks the account icon, direct them to a dedicated account page after signing in, instead of returning to the authentication page.
Once signed in, users should stay logged in until they manually log out.
Create an account page that displays all user details and order history.
Apply the same theme and typography as the landing page, and use the previously provided image where suitable for design.

PROMPT 14
For all products with the same name, make them count as a single item in the cart no matter which page they‚Äôre added from. Also, always show the same product image for them everywhere on the site.

PROMPT 15
Update product images so that, for any image I provide, all products with the matching name (across both figures and katana) have their images changed to the new one.
Also, change the product name and description for ‚ÄúZoro Three Sword Style‚Äù to ‚ÄúKikoku Law‚Äôs Katana‚Äù with a matching new description.
Use each attached image to update the product with the same name.

PROMPT 16
If the user is logged in and clicks the ‚ÄúStart Adventure‚Äù button, redirect them to a simple page prompting them to subscribe to a newsletter. The new page should match the theme and typography of the landing page.
